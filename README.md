# CTF-Challenges
The idea is to build a CTF platform where the noobs (like me :) ) can find their strength and confidence which can turn them into the knowbies. So, trying to put the effort to make a noobie-friendly CTF resource. 



A brief of what a CTF is, especially in the world of Cyber Security:

CTF means Capture The Flag. Traditionally CTF was just an outdoor sport where teams participate and try to find (Capture) the hidden flags from the given location. But in the Cyber World CTF means to find the hidden flags into the websites (may be source code, js file, or any other functionality of the website), images, videos, audios, executables, APKs, and the list goes on. 



Benefits of doing CTF challenges:

1) You get to practice various security-related tools in a fun way. 

2) Finding a Flag successfully would help to boost the confidence :)

3) Not finding a flag successfully would help to improve the approach or maybe changing the approach of doing the things (like changing the way you use certain tools).

4) Doing CTF challenges could help to master not just one area of Cyber Security but many as CTF can be of many different Categories like WEb, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Misc, etc
